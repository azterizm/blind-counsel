"""Device-side egress guard (capability/taint style, after CaMeL).

Every value derived from the private case record is wrapped `Tainted`. The guard
allows bytes to leave the device on exactly two public channels:

  "sync" : public artifacts the device pulled from the cloud and echoes back (the
           catalogue / task program). Must contain no tainted data.
  "pir"  : a SimplePIR query vector. This is the ONLY channel whose content depends
           (indirectly) on the case -- it encodes which statute row is wanted. That
           dependence is cryptographically hidden: the query is an LWE sample,
           pseudorandom and of a distribution independent of the index. The guard
           therefore "declassifies" a PIR query only if it is a fixed-shape int64
           vector in [0, Q) that passes a uniformity sanity check -- i.e. it is a
           ciphertext, not raw tainted data smuggled out.

Anything else carrying tainted bytes is blocked and logged as a leak attempt. The
evaluation scans everything that left for any secret substring; it must be zero.
