"""Device-side deterministic calculators (local; no model does arithmetic).

Inputs are only:
  * client facts the device model extracted AND that were verified against the
    client's own words (the date/amount must appear in the quoted sentence), and
  * statutory parameters precomputed by the cloud AND re-verified on the device
    against the PIR-fetched statute (the number must appear in the statute quote).
If an input is missing, the calculator says so instead of guessing.
